Frodo Baggins never imagined he'd spend his days on stage, sharing his story with auditoriums full of strangers. Yet here he is, three years into a speaking career that has taken him across Middle-earth and beyond.

"The irony isn't lost on me," Frodo says with a gentle smile. "I spent so much of my journey trying to stay hidden, to go unnoticed. Now I'm actively seeking audiences. Sam finds it hilarious."

His talks don't focus on the epic battles or the dramatic moments. Instead, Frodo speaks about the small steps, the daily choice to continue when everything in you wants to stop. It's a message that resonates deeply with audiences facing their own struggles.

"People come expecting to hear about Mount Doom, about destroying the Ring," he explains. "And yes, that's part of it. But what I really talk about is the morning in the Dead Marshes when I couldn't remember why I was doing this. Or the hundredth time my feet were bleeding and I had to choose to take another step."

The decision to become a speaker came during a particularly difficult period after his return to the Shire. While his friends had readjusted to normal life, Frodo found himself struggling with purpose and the weight of his memories.

"A local teacher asked me to speak to her students about perseverance. I almost said no. But something made me say yes, and when I saw how these young people connected with the idea that even the smallest person can make a difference... I realized I had more work to do."

His approach is refreshingly honest. Frodo doesn't position himself as a hero or an expert. He shares his doubts, his failures, the moments he needed to be carried—literally and figuratively. This vulnerability has become his signature.

"I tell them about the times I failed. The times I wanted to give up. The times I did give up, and someone else had to help me keep going. Because that's real. That's what they need to hear."

He's also adapted his message for different audiences. Corporate groups hear about teamwork and trusting your fellowship. Students learn about facing fears despite inadequacy. Support groups for trauma survivors receive a different talk entirely—one Frodo crafted with help from counselors in Rivendell.

The travel can be exhausting, and Frodo maintains strict boundaries about his schedule. "I learned the hard way that I can't save everyone. I have to save myself first, or I'm no good to anyone. That's a lesson I wish I'd understood earlier."

Between speaking engagements, Frodo has been writing a book—not about his journey, which Bilbo already chronicled, but a practical guide to overcoming adversity. "It's not about grand gestures. It's about the small, daily practices that keep you moving forward."

When asked about his greatest accomplishment since becoming a speaker, Frodo doesn't hesitate. "I get letters. Hundreds of them. People telling me they took that next step, they climbed their mountain, they asked for help when they needed it. Every single one reminds me why I do this."

As our conversation ends, Frodo prepares for his next talk—a university commencement address. "I'm going to tell them the same thing I tell everyone: You don't have to be special to do something extraordinary. You just have to show up and keep going, one step at a time."
