# MCP example Netlify Express

## About this example site

This site shows a very a basic example of developing and running serverless MCP using Netlify Functions. It includes links to a deployed serverless function and an example of accessing the function using a customized URL.

- [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)
- [Docs: Netlify Functions](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/overview/?utm_campaign=dx-examples&utm_source=example-site&utm_medium=web&utm_content=example-mcp-express)
- [Agent Experience (AX)](https://agentexperience.ax?utm_source=express-mcp-guide&utm_medium=web&utm_content=example-mcp-express)

Importantly, because of how Express handles mapping routes, ensure you set the `netlify.toml` redirects to the correct path. In this example we have the following to ensure <domain>/mcp catches all of the requests to this server:

```toml
[[redirects]]
  force = true
  from = "/mcp"
  status = 200
  to = "/.netlify/functions/express-mcp-server"
```
