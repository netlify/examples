## About this example site

This site shows a starter example for using Netlify serverless functions and Stytch Identity to provide an authenticated MCP server exposing user-scoped data to agents.

This site uses the [Stytch Consumer](https://stytch.com/b2c) product, which is purpose-built for Consumer SaaS authentication requirements.
B2B SaaS applications should evaluate Stytch's [B2B](https://stytch.com/b2b) product as well.

Deploy your own version of this example site, by clicking the Deploy to Netlify Button below. This will automatically:

- Clone a copy of this example from the examples repo to your own GitHub account
- Create a new project in your [Netlify account](https://app.netlify.com/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=github&utm_campaign=devex-ph&utm_content=devex-examples), linked to your new repo
- Create an automated deployment pipeline to watch for changes on your repo
- Build and deploy your new site
- This repo can then be used to iterate on locally using `netlify dev`

### In the Stytch Dashboard

1. Create a [Stytch](https://stytch.com/) account. Within the sign up flow select **Consumer Authentication** as the authentication type you are interested in. Once your account is set up a Project called "My first project" will be automatically created for you.

2. Navigate to [Frontend SDKs](https://stytch.com/dashboard/sdk-configuration?env=test) to enable the Frontend SDK in Test

3. Navigate to [Connected Apps](https://stytch.com/dashboard/connected-apps?env=test) to enable Dynamic Client Registration and configure your authorization URL as `http://localhost:3000/oauth/authorize`.

4. Navigate to [Project Settings](https://stytch.com/dashboard/project-settings?env=test) to view your Project ID and API keys. You will need these values later.

### Required Environment Variables

- `STYTCH_PROJECT_ID` - Your Stytch project ID from the [Stytch Dashboard](https://stytch.com/dashboard)
- `STYTCH_SECRET` - Your Stytch project secret
- `STYTCH_DOMAIN` - Your Stytch project domain

### Setting up Environment Variables

#### For Local Development

1. Copy the example file:
   ```shell
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```

2. Fill in your actual values in `.env.local`

#### For Netlify Deployment

Set environment variables in your Netlify site dashboard:
1. Go to Site Settings â†’ Environment Variables
2. Add each required variable with your actual values

Alternatively, use the Netlify CLI:
```shell
netlify env:set STYTCH_PROJECT_ID "your-project-id"
netlify env:set STYTCH_DOMAIN "your-project-domain"
netlify env:set STYTCH_SECRET "your-secret" --secret
netlify env:set OPENAI_API_KEY "your-openai-key" --secret
```

## Install and run the examples locally

You can clone this entire examples repo to explore this and other examples, and to run them locally.

```shell

# 1. Clone the examples repository to your local development environment
git clone git@github.com:netlify/examples

# 2. Move into the project directory for this example
cd examples/mcp/serverless-mcp

# 3. Set up environment variables (see Environment Variables Setup above)
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your actual values

# 4. Install the Netlify CLI to let you locally serve your site using Netlify's features
npm i -g netlify-cli

# 5. Serve your site using Netlify Dev to get local serverless functions
netlify dev

# 6. While the site is running locally, open a separate terminal tab to run the MCP inspector or client you desire
