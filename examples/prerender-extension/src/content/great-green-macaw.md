# Great Green Macaw

The Great Green Macaw is Central America's largest parrot and one of Costa Rica's most critically endangered birds. With its impressive size, vibrant green plumage, and dependence on a single tree species for nesting, this magnificent bird has become a flagship for rainforest conservation. Successful recovery efforts in Costa Rica demonstrate that targeted conservation can reverse population declines for even highly threatened species.

## Physical Characteristics

Great Green Macaws are massive parrots measuring 77-85 cm in total length, with their long tail accounting for much of this measurement. They weigh 1,300-1,700 grams, making them substantially heavier than Scarlet Macaws. This species is the largest parrot in Central America and one of the largest in the Americas.

The predominant plumage is bright lime green, lighter than typical rainforest greens. The forehead displays a distinctive red patch, and a few red feathers are scattered on the wings. Flight feathers show blue on the outer primaries and tail. The massive bill is horn-colored with a black lower mandible.

Bare facial skin is pale with narrow lines of small red feathers. Eyes are pale yellow in adults. The overall impression is of a large, primarily green parrot with subtle accents, less dramatically colorful than Scarlet Macaws but equally impressive.

Sexual dimorphism is minimal, with males averaging slightly larger. Juveniles show darker eyes and less defined red markings.

## Habitat and Critical Tree Dependency

Great Green Macaws inhabit humid lowland rainforests of the Caribbean slope, from sea level to approximately 600 meters elevation. Their distribution closely follows that of the almendro tree (Dipteryx panamensis), also called mountain almond.

This dependence on almendro trees represents one of the species' most significant ecological characteristics. Great Green Macaws:

- Nest almost exclusively in large, old almendro trees
- Feed heavily on almendro seeds during fruiting season
- Require trees large enough to contain suitable cavities

Almendro trees grow slowly and require decades to reach dimensions suitable for macaw nesting. Old-growth forest provides the essential combination of large almendro trees for nesting and diverse food sources throughout the year.

Key habitat areas include the Sarapiquí region, Tortuguero Conservation Area, Braulio Carrillo National Park, and the San Juan-La Selva corridor.

## Social Behavior and Intelligence

Great Green Macaws are highly social and intelligent birds. Outside breeding season, they travel in flocks of 4-12 individuals, though larger aggregations may gather at productive food sources. Mated pairs maintain strong bonds year-round, frequently seen flying close together with synchronized wingbeats.

Their intelligence manifests in multiple ways:

- Complex social relationships within flocks
- Sophisticated vocal communication
- Problem-solving abilities when foraging
- Extended parental care periods teaching young birds

Long-term studies suggest individual recognition between birds, with specific calls used between mates and family members. Young macaws remain with parents for extended periods, learning foraging techniques and important resource locations.

## Vocalizations

Great Green Macaws produce loud, harsh calls typical of large parrots. Their vocalizations carry long distances through the rainforest, often heard before birds are seen. Calls include:

- Loud, raucous squawks and screeches
- Softer contact calls between flock members
- Specific alarm calls for predators
- Begging calls from juveniles

Vocal activity peaks during morning and evening flight periods as birds move between roosting and feeding sites. The calls help maintain flock cohesion and may serve territorial functions.

## Diet and Foraging

While almendro seeds are crucial seasonally, Great Green Macaws consume diverse foods:

- **Seeds and nuts**: Almendro, various palms, and hardwood tree seeds
- **Fruits**: Figs, tropical almonds, and diverse rainforest fruits
- **Flowers**: Nectar and flower parts from canopy trees
- **Leaves**: Young leaves and leaf buds

The powerful bill cracks extremely hard nuts inaccessible to other species. This ability allows exploitation of resources unavailable to competitors. Macaws sometimes feed on unripe fruits containing toxins, visiting clay licks afterward to neutralize harmful compounds.

Foraging occurs primarily in the canopy, with birds moving through the forest following seasonal fruiting patterns. Home ranges are large, potentially covering several square kilometers.

## Breeding Biology

Great Green Macaws breed during the first half of the year, with timing varying by location and almendro fruiting patterns. They are monogamous, potentially mating for life. Pairs often reuse the same nest cavity across years if successful.

Nest cavities are almost exclusively in large almendro trees, typically in naturally formed hollows 20-30 meters above ground. The female lays 2-3 eggs on bare wood with no nest material. Incubation lasts approximately 26-28 days, performed primarily by the female while the male brings food.

Chicks are altricial, hatching naked and helpless. The nestling period extends 12-14 weeks, among the longest for any parrot. After fledging, juveniles remain dependent on parents for several months, learning essential survival skills.

Reproductive rates are naturally low, with successful pairs raising typically 1-2 chicks per year. This slow reproduction makes populations vulnerable to disturbance and reduces recovery potential.

## Conservation Crisis and Recovery

The Great Green Macaw is classified as Critically Endangered, having suffered severe population declines throughout its range. By the 1990s, Costa Rican populations had been reduced to approximately 200 individuals.

Primary threats include:

- Logging of almendro trees for valuable timber
- Rainforest conversion to agriculture and cattle pasture
- Illegal capture for pet trade
- Limited remaining suitable habitat
- Small population size creating genetic concerns

Targeted conservation efforts have produced encouraging results:

- Protection of key almendro groves
- Artificial nest box programs
- Community engagement and education
- Habitat corridor creation
- Anti-poaching enforcement
- Population monitoring

Recent surveys suggest Costa Rican populations have increased to 500-600 individuals, demonstrating conservation success. However, the species remains critically endangered and requires ongoing protection.

## The Almendro Tree Partnership

Conservation of Great Green Macaws necessarily involves protecting almendro trees and old-growth forest. This has created interesting partnerships between conservation organizations, local communities, and landowners.

Programs provide economic incentives for protecting almendro trees on private land. Landowners receive payments for conservation, creating alternatives to logging. This approach recognizes that conservation must address human economic needs alongside wildlife protection.

The macaw has become a symbol of rainforest conservation in northern Costa Rica, featuring prominently in ecotourism and education programs. Its recovery demonstrates tangible conservation success, inspiring continued efforts.

## Observation and Ecotourism

Finding Great Green Macaws requires visiting their limited range during appropriate times. Best opportunities include:

- Maquenque National Wildlife Refuge
- Sarapiquí region with local guides
- Tirimbina Rainforest Reserve area
- La Selva Biological Station surroundings

The species is most easily located when birds fly between roosting and feeding sites during early morning and late afternoon. Their loud calls often provide the first indication of presence. Patient observation at known nest trees during breeding season offers close views.

Responsible ecotourism focused on the macaw provides economic benefits supporting conservation. Several community-based tourism initiatives in the Sarapiquí region now feature macaw viewing as a primary attraction, creating livelihoods dependent on the bird's survival.

## Hope for Recovery

The Great Green Macaw's story demonstrates that even critically endangered species can recover with dedicated conservation effort. The Costa Rican population's growth shows positive results from protecting habitat, reducing poaching, and engaging local communities.

However, long-term survival requires continued vigilance. Climate change, ongoing deforestation pressure, and the species' slow reproductive rate mean populations remain vulnerable. The macaw's future ultimately depends on maintaining extensive rainforest ecosystems throughout its range.

For conservation biologists and local communities alike, the Great Green Macaw represents both a success story and an ongoing responsibility. Its recovery inspires hope while reminding us that conservation requires sustained, long-term commitment.
