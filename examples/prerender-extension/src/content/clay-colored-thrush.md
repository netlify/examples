# Clay-colored Thrush

The Clay-colored Thrush holds the distinction of being Costa Rica's national bird, selected in 1977 for its ubiquitous presence and melodious song that announces the arrival of the rainy season. Known locally as "yigüirro," this unassuming brown bird has captured the hearts of Costa Ricans through its beautiful vocalizations and adaptation to human-modified landscapes.

## Physical Characteristics

The Clay-colored Thrush is a medium-sized songbird measuring 23-27 cm in length and weighing 74-76 grams. True to its name, the plumage is predominantly clay-brown or tawny-olive throughout. The underparts are slightly paler than the back, and the throat displays faint streaking.

The bill is yellowish-green with a darker culmen, and legs are pinkish-brown. Eyes are reddish-brown, surrounded by a pale eye-ring. Males and females are virtually identical in appearance, making visual sex determination impossible in the field. Juveniles show spotted plumage on the breast, similar to other thrush species.

The overall appearance is plain compared to many tropical birds, yet this simplicity contributes to the species' charm and symbolic representation of Costa Rican humility and natural beauty.

## Habitat and Distribution

Clay-colored Thrushes demonstrate remarkable adaptability, thriving across diverse habitats from sea level to approximately 2,500 meters elevation. They inhabit:

- Urban parks and gardens
- Agricultural areas and coffee plantations
- Forest edges and clearings
- Secondary growth and disturbed areas
- Residential neighborhoods

This adaptability has allowed the species to flourish throughout Costa Rica and expand its range alongside human development. The thrush is equally at home in San José's city parks as in rural farmland, making it accessible to all Costa Ricans regardless of location.

Originally more restricted to forest edges and semi-open areas, Clay-colored Thrushes have capitalized on deforestation and agricultural expansion, actually increasing in abundance as human modification of landscapes has progressed.

## The Famous Song

The melodious song of the Clay-colored Thrush represents one of Costa Rica's most beloved natural sounds. Males sing from exposed perches, delivering rich, fluty whistles in varied phrases. The song incorporates clear notes interspersed with harsher sounds, creating a complex and pleasing melody.

Singing intensifies dramatically with the onset of the rainy season, typically beginning in April. This timing has led to the bird's association with seasonal changes and agricultural cycles. For generations, Costa Rican farmers have relied on the yigüirro's song as a natural indicator to begin planting.

Both dawn and dusk see peak singing activity, though males may sing throughout the day during breeding season. The song serves territorial functions and attracts females, with males defending territories of variable size depending on habitat quality.

## Diet and Foraging

Clay-colored Thrushes are omnivorous, consuming a diverse diet that varies seasonally:

- **Fruits**: Berries, small fruits, particularly from ornamental plants in gardens
- **Insects**: Beetles, ants, termites, caterpillars, and other invertebrates
- **Earthworms**: Especially abundant food source during rainy season
- **Small vertebrates**: Occasionally small lizards or frogs

Foraging occurs primarily on the ground, where thrushes hop across lawns and leaf litter searching for prey. They use their bills to flip leaves and probe soil for hidden invertebrates. Fruit is typically taken from shrubs and trees, with birds either perching to feed or hovering briefly to snatch berries.

Urban populations have adapted to exploit human food sources opportunistically, though natural foods remain dietary staples.

## Breeding Behavior

Breeding season extends from March through July, coinciding with the rainy season when food becomes abundant. Clay-colored Thrushes are monogamous, with pairs defending territories.

Nests are substantial cup-shaped structures built from twigs, roots, and mud, lined with finer materials. Typical placement includes:

- Tree forks and branches
- Building ledges and eaves
- Dense shrubs
- Occasionally on the ground in protected locations

Females lay 2-3 pale blue eggs marked with brown spots. Incubation lasts about 12-14 days, performed primarily by the female. Both parents feed nestlings, which fledge at approximately 13-15 days old.

Clay-colored Thrushes often raise multiple broods per season. They vigorously defend nests against predators and intruders, including much larger birds and even humans who approach too closely.

## As National Bird

The selection of the Clay-colored Thrush as Costa Rica's national bird reflects the country's values and relationship with nature. Rather than choosing a rare or spectacular species, Costa Ricans selected a bird that:

- Represents accessibility of nature to all citizens
- Symbolizes the country's commitment to coexistence with wildlife
- Connects to agricultural traditions and rural heritage
- Demonstrates that beauty exists in simplicity

The yigüirro appears in Costa Rican literature, music, and art. School children learn about the bird and its role in Costa Rican culture. The species serves as an ambassador for wildlife conservation, proving that common species deserve appreciation alongside rare and endangered ones.

## Cultural Significance

Beyond its status as national bird, the Clay-colored Thrush features prominently in Costa Rican folklore and tradition. The bird's song announcing the rains has inspired poetry and music. Rural communities maintain traditional knowledge about the yigüirro's behavior as indicators of weather patterns.

In March, when the first sustained singing begins, Costa Ricans take note, knowing the dry season nears its end. This natural calendar has guided agricultural practices for generations, though modern farming increasingly relies on meteorological data.

## Conservation

As a Least Concern species with expanding populations, the Clay-colored Thrush faces no immediate conservation threats. The species has proven remarkably resilient, thriving in human-modified environments where many other birds have declined.

However, the thrush's success raises important questions about conservation priorities. While the species flourishes, its abundance in degraded habitats should not obscure the loss of forest-dependent birds. The yigüirro's presence in cities and farms cannot replace the ecological roles of specialized species requiring intact forest.

Nonetheless, the Clay-colored Thrush serves valuable functions even in modified landscapes, including insect control and seed dispersal for native and ornamental plants.

## Observation

Perhaps no Costa Rican bird is easier to observe than the Clay-colored Thrush. Any park, garden, or green space likely hosts these birds. Early morning provides the best opportunity to hear their full song repertoire. Watch for them foraging on lawns, perched on fences and wires, or singing from tree tops.

Their approachability and tolerance of human presence make them ideal for beginning birders and nature photographers. The yigüirro proves that spectacular plumage isn't necessary for a bird to capture human imagination and affection.
