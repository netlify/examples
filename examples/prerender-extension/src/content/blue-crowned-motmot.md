# Blue-crowned Motmot

The Blue-crowned Motmot is perhaps Costa Rica's most commonly encountered motmot species, frequently observed in gardens, parks, and forest edges throughout much of the country. With its gorgeous blue crown, distinctive racquet-tipped tail, and endearing tail-swinging behavior, this charismatic bird has become a favorite among both birders and casual nature observers. Its adaptability to human-modified landscapes ensures it remains one of the few large, colorful birds accessible even to urban residents.

## Physical Characteristics

Blue-crowned Motmots measure 38-43 cm in total length, with the elongated tail accounting for much of this measurement. The body length is approximately 25 cm, and weight ranges from 100-140 grams.

The plumage is predominantly green on the back and wings, transitioning to cinnamon-rufous on the breast and belly. The head features a beautiful blue crown and nape, with black bordering the blue on the forecrown and extending as a mask through the eyes. A small black patch marks the throat. Some individuals show turquoise coloring rather than pure blue on the crown.

The long tail is blue-green, with the central tail feathers extending beyond the others and terminating in distinctive racquet-shaped tips. As with other motmots, these racquets form through natural feather structure and preening behavior rather than damage.

The bill is broad, slightly decurved, and black with serrated edges. Males and females appear identical. Juveniles show similar patterns but with duller colors and incompletely developed tail racquets.

## Habitat and Adaptability

Blue-crowned Motmots demonstrate remarkable habitat flexibility, occurring across diverse environments from sea level to approximately 2,500 meters elevation. This adaptability distinguishes them from many tropical forest specialists.

Habitat includes:

- Humid and dry forests
- Forest edges and clearings
- Coffee and cacao plantations with shade trees
- Urban parks and gardens with large trees
- Second-growth and disturbed areas
- Gallery forests along streams

Unlike species requiring intact forest, Blue-crowned Motmots thrive in human-modified landscapes provided some tree cover remains. Urban parks in San José host populations, and the species regularly visits garden bird feeders.

This adaptability has likely increased Blue-crowned Motmot abundance and range as agriculture and urbanization created edge habitat throughout Costa Rica. While habitat generalists, they still require certain features—perches for hunting, trees with suitable cavities or earth banks for nesting, and adequate prey populations.

## Behavior and Tail-Swinging

The pendulum-like tail-swinging behavior exhibited by all motmots is particularly noticeable in Blue-crowned Motmots due to their abundance and habitat accessibility. Perched birds slowly swing their tails from side to side, the racquet tips creating a mesmerizing movement.

Various hypotheses explain this behavior:

- Drawing predator strikes toward the expendable tail rather than vital organs
- Visual communication with other motmots
- Insect attraction making prey easier to detect
- Simply a stereotyped behavior without current adaptive significance

Research has not conclusively determined the function, though the behavior's persistence across all motmot species suggests it provides some benefit.

Birds spend considerable time perched quietly, scanning for prey. This sit-and-wait strategy conserves energy while allowing detection of movement across wide areas. When prey is spotted, the bird sallies forth to capture it, returning to the same or a nearby perch.

## Vocalizations

Blue-crowned Motmots produce a distinctive hooting call, typically rendered as a soft, low "hoot-hoot" or "whoop-whoop" delivered in evenly spaced pairs. The calls carry well through vegetation and are often the first indication of presence.

Calling peaks during early morning and late afternoon, with reduced activity during midday. Both sexes call, possibly serving territorial functions and maintaining pair bonds.

The calls of Blue-crowned Motmots differ subtly from those of Lesson's Motmot and other congeners, aiding identification where ranges overlap. Patient observers learn to distinguish species by voice alone.

During aggressive encounters or when alarmed, birds produce harsh chattering calls and mechanical bill-snapping sounds.

## Diet and Foraging

Blue-crowned Motmots are omnivorous, consuming both animal prey and fruits. This dietary flexibility contributes to their ecological success across varied habitats.

Animal prey includes:

- Large insects: beetles, cicadas, grasshoppers, katydids
- Spiders and other arthropods
- Small vertebrates: lizards, small snakes, frogs, nestling birds
- Occasionally small mammals

Fruits form an important dietary component, particularly:

- Berries from various shrubs and trees
- Small palm fruits
- Figs
- Ornamental fruits in gardens

Foraging occurs primarily through sit-and-wait predation from exposed perches. Birds scan surroundings, sallying out to capture detected prey. Large prey items are beaten against the perch before consumption, and indigestible parts are regurgitated as pellets.

The omnivorous diet allows Blue-crowned Motmots to exploit seasonally variable food sources, switching between fruits and animal prey as availability changes.

## Breeding Biology

Blue-crowned Motmots breed during the dry season and early wet season (February-July), with timing varying regionally. They are monogamous, often maintaining pair bonds across years.

Nests are burrows excavated in earth banks, similar to kingfisher nesting. Suitable sites include:

- Stream and river banks
- Road cuts and erosion features
- Exposed soil in forest gaps
- Sometimes flat ground with appropriate soil

Both sexes participate in burrow excavation, creating tunnels 1-2 meters long terminating in an enlarged chamber. Excavation may require several weeks.

The female lays 3-4 white eggs on the bare chamber floor. Both parents share incubation for approximately 21-22 days. Nestlings are fed regurgitated food, fledging at about 28-31 days old.

Burrows become fouled during the nestling period but are typically abandoned after use rather than cleaned for reuse in subsequent years.

## Urban and Garden Birds

Blue-crowned Motmots' success in gardens and urban areas makes them unusually accessible for large, colorful tropical birds. Many Costa Rican residents host motmots in their yards, appreciating their beauty and insect-eating services.

Urban adaptation includes:

- Nesting in garden banks and retaining walls
- Foraging in lawns and ornamental plantings
- Using garden perches and structures
- Tolerating human presence and activity

This urban tolerance provides important conservation benefits. City dwellers who observe motmots in their daily lives develop appreciation for wildlife and support for conservation. The birds demonstrate that coexistence with wildlife is possible in modified landscapes.

Some enthusiasts provide nesting sites by creating artificial banks or leaving earth slopes undisturbed. While motmots don't typically use nest boxes, they readily exploit suitable earth banks in gardens.

## Conservation Status

Blue-crowned Motmots are listed as Least Concern with stable, possibly increasing populations. Their habitat adaptability and omnivorous diet provide resilience to environmental changes that threaten more specialized species.

The species faces minimal conservation threats in Costa Rica. Pesticide use might reduce prey populations locally, and some birds are killed by cats or die in collisions with windows, but these impacts appear insufficient to affect overall populations.

The species' success demonstrates that not all tropical birds require pristine forest. Blue-crowned Motmots exemplify how some species can thrive alongside humans when appropriate habitat features are maintained.

## Observation and Photography

Blue-crowned Motmots rank among the easiest large, colorful birds to observe in Costa Rica. Their abundance, habitat accessibility, and tolerance of humans provide excellent viewing opportunities.

Observation strategies:

- Check garden perches and fence posts in rural areas
- Walk forest edges listening for calls
- Visit urban parks with mature trees
- Early morning and late afternoon for peak activity

The perch-hunting behavior makes them excellent photography subjects. Birds remain stationary for extended periods, allowing careful approach and positioning. The tail-swinging provides engaging behavior to photograph.

Many lodges and homes throughout Costa Rica have resident motmots that become accustomed to human presence, providing reliable viewing for guests and residents alike.

## Ecological Role

As predators of insects and small vertebrates, Blue-crowned Motmots contribute to natural pest control. Their consumption of large insects benefits gardens and agricultural areas.

Frugivory makes them seed dispersers for various plants, though this represents a minor ecological role compared to specialized frugivores.

Their burrow excavation creates cavities that may be used by other species after abandonment, though the extent of this impact remains understudied.

The species' abundance and wide distribution make them ecologically significant despite being habitat generalists. Understanding how common, adaptable species function in ecosystems complements research on rare specialists.
