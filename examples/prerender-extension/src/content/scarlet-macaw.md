# Scarlet Macaw

The Scarlet Macaw is among the most iconic and recognizable parrots in the world. Its spectacular plumage combines brilliant scarlet red covering most of the body, bright yellow wing coverts, and stunning blue flight feathers. These intelligent and social birds are a flagship species for tropical forest conservation in Costa Rica.

## Physical Characteristics

Scarlet Macaws are impressively large parrots, measuring 81-96 cm from beak to tail tip. Their wingspan can reach up to one meter. Adults typically weigh between 900-1500 grams, with minimal size difference between sexes.

The massive curved beak is perfectly adapted for cracking hard nuts and seeds. The upper mandible is predominantly horn-colored with black on the sides, while the lower mandible is entirely black. Bare white facial skin surrounds the eyes, and the long graduated tail accounts for more than half the bird's total length.

## Habitat and Range

In Costa Rica, Scarlet Macaws inhabit two geographically separate populations:

- **Pacific Population**: Carara National Park and the Osa Peninsula, particularly around Corcovado National Park
- **Historic Range**: Once widespread across Pacific lowlands, now restricted to protected areas

These birds prefer humid evergreen forests, gallery forests along rivers, and deciduous forests. They can be found from sea level up to 600 meters elevation, occasionally reaching 1000 meters.

## Social Behavior

Scarlet Macaws are highly social birds, typically seen in pairs or family groups. Larger flocks may gather at feeding sites or communal roosts, sometimes numbering 30 or more individuals. Mated pairs maintain strong bonds and are often observed flying close together, wings nearly touching.

Communication includes loud, harsh screams and squawks that can be heard over considerable distances. These vocalizations serve to maintain contact between flock members and defend territory. Their calls are particularly dramatic at dawn and dusk during flight to and from roosting sites.

## Diet and Foraging

Scarlet Macaws have a varied diet consisting primarily of:

- Seeds and nuts (particularly almendro and beach almond trees)
- Fruits of numerous forest species
- Flowers and nectar
- Clay from riverbanks (provides minerals and neutralizes toxins)

Their powerful beaks can crack open extremely hard nuts that other species cannot access. Interestingly, macaws sometimes consume unripe fruits containing toxins that would sicken other animals, visiting clay licks to neutralize these compounds.

## Reproduction

Breeding season in Costa Rica typically runs from November to April. Scarlet Macaws are monogamous and maintain long-term pair bonds, potentially mating for life. They nest in cavities of large trees, particularly favoring beach almond and ceiba trees.

Females lay 2-4 white eggs, with incubation lasting approximately 24-28 days. Chicks fledge at about 90 days but remain dependent on parents for several months afterward. Only one or two chicks typically survive to fledging, even when more eggs are laid.

Young macaws don't reach sexual maturity until 3-4 years of age. This slow reproductive rate, combined with high nest predation, makes populations vulnerable to disturbance.

## Conservation Challenges

While listed as Least Concern globally, Costa Rican populations have faced severe pressure. By the 1990s, the species had been nearly eliminated from much of its historic range. Conservation challenges include:

- Illegal pet trade and poaching of chicks
- Deforestation eliminating nesting trees and food sources
- Limited connectivity between isolated populations
- Competition for nest cavities

Successful conservation efforts in Carara National Park and the Osa Peninsula have stabilized and even increased local populations. The installation of artificial nest boxes has helped address cavity shortages. Strong ecotourism programs now provide economic incentives for protection.

## Ecotourism and Observation

Costa Rica has become one of the best places in Central America to observe wild Scarlet Macaws. Reliable viewing locations include:

- Carara National Park and surrounding areas
- Corcovado National Park (Osa Peninsula)
- Drake Bay region
- Tárcoles River area

Early morning and late afternoon offer the best viewing opportunities as birds fly to and from roosting sites. The distinctive silhouette and loud calls make them relatively easy to spot when present.
