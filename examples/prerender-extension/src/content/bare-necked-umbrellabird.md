# Bare-necked Umbrellabird

The Bare-necked Umbrellabird is one of Costa Rica's most unusual and sought-after birds. Males display extraordinary ornamentation including a large umbrella-like crest and an inflatable red wattle hanging from the throat. This rare and elusive species undertakes remarkable altitudinal migrations and faces significant conservation challenges due to habitat loss.

## Physical Characteristics

Bare-necked Umbrellabirds are large cotingas, with males measuring approximately 41 cm in length and weighing up to 450 grams. Females are considerably smaller at roughly 33 cm. The species exhibits pronounced sexual dimorphism.

Adult males are entirely black with a bushy, umbrella-shaped crest that can be raised or lowered. The most striking feature is the inflatable throat wattle covered in bright red skin with sparse bristly feathers. This wattle can extend up to 30 cm when fully inflated during displays, though it typically hangs shortened against the chest.

Females lack the elaborate ornaments of males, appearing entirely black with a reduced crest and no wattle. Juveniles resemble females but show brownish tones in the plumage.

The broad wings produce loud whooshing sounds in flight, audible at considerable distances. This mechanical sound may serve communication functions during migration and breeding.

## Habitat and Altitudinal Migration

Bare-necked Umbrellabirds demonstrate remarkable altitudinal migration patterns unique among Costa Rican birds. During breeding season (roughly March through June), they inhabit foothill forests on the Caribbean slope at elevations between 600-1,200 meters, particularly in areas with ravines and valleys.

During non-breeding season, birds migrate to lowland forests, descending to near sea level. This migration appears driven by food availability, particularly fruiting patterns of key tree species.

Habitat requirements include:

- Mature humid forest with tall trees
- Dense canopy cover
- Presence of specific fruiting trees
- Minimal human disturbance

Key locations in Costa Rica include Braulio Carrillo National Park, La Selva Biological Station area (seasonally), and scattered forest patches in the Caribbean lowlands. The species' dependence on extensive forest makes it sensitive to fragmentation.

## The Remarkable Display

Male Bare-necked Umbrellabirds perform elaborate courtship displays that rank among the most spectacular in the bird world. During breeding season, males gather in loose leks where they display for females.

The display involves:

- Fully erecting the umbrella crest
- Inflating the red throat wattle to maximum extension
- Deep, resonant booming calls
- Horizontal posturing with wings drooped
- Jumping movements on display perches

The booming vocalization carries through the forest, described as a deep, hollow "WHUUUUM" sound produced by air forced through the inflated wattle. These calls can be heard over 100 meters away in dense forest.

Males compete for prime display territories, with dominance determined by display vigor and physical condition. Females visit leks to assess males, mating with preferred individuals before departing to nest alone.

## Diet and Foraging

Bare-necked Umbrellabirds are primarily frugivorous, consuming a variety of forest fruits. Their relatively large size allows them to swallow larger fruits than most frugivorous birds. Key dietary items include:

- Laurel family fruits (particularly important)
- Palm fruits
- Various tropical tree fruits
- Large insects (supplemental protein)

Foraging occurs primarily in the forest canopy, where birds move deliberately through fruiting trees. They pluck fruits while perched or occasionally hover briefly to snatch items from branch tips. After swallowing fruits whole, birds regurgitate seeds, contributing to forest regeneration.

During breeding season, males reduce foraging time to maximize display effort. Females must meet nutritional demands of egg production and incubation while foraging independently.

## Breeding Biology

The breeding system is classified as lek polygyny, with males providing no parental care. After mating at lek sites, females construct nests entirely alone in forest away from lek areas.

Nests are bulky platforms of sticks and vegetation placed in tree forks or against tree trunks at moderate heights. A single egg is laid, one of the smallest clutch sizes among Costa Rican birds. This reflects the species' bet-hedging strategy in unpredictable environments.

Incubation lasts approximately 28 days, with the female leaving only briefly to forage. The nestling period extends roughly 30-35 days, with the female providing all parental care. Young birds remain dependent on the mother for weeks after fledging as they learn to find appropriate foods.

## Conservation Status

The Bare-necked Umbrellabird is classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN, facing significant threats throughout its range:

- Deforestation eliminating breeding and wintering habitat
- Forest fragmentation disrupting migration routes
- Small total population size increasing extinction risk
- Restricted geographic range
- Dependence on mature forest

In Costa Rica, the species survives primarily in protected areas, particularly Braulio Carrillo National Park. However, even protected populations face threats from climate change potentially affecting fruiting patterns and forest composition.

Conservation priorities include:

- Protecting elevational migration corridors
- Maintaining mature forest in breeding areas
- Reducing hunting (birds were historically hunted for food)
- Monitoring population trends
- Protecting lowland wintering areas

## Research and Monitoring

Bare-necked Umbrellabirds have been subjects of important ecological research, particularly regarding altitudinal migration and lek breeding systems. Radio-telemetry studies have tracked individual movements between breeding and non-breeding areas, revealing migration patterns and habitat use.

Long-term monitoring at lek sites provides data on population trends and breeding success. These studies prove challenging due to the species' remote habitat, low population density, and secretive nature outside breeding season.

## Observation Opportunities

Finding Bare-necked Umbrellabirds requires considerable effort, expertise, and luck. The species ranks among Costa Rica's most difficult to observe. Best opportunities include:

- Hiring experienced local guides familiar with current lek locations
- Visiting during breeding season (March-June) when males display
- Early morning when display activity peaks
- Areas near Braulio Carrillo at appropriate elevations

The deep booming calls may be the first indication of presence. Even when located, views are often brief and partial due to dense forest canopy. Patience and persistence are essential.

For serious birders, successfully observing this remarkable species represents a highlight of Costa Rican birding. The experience emphasizes the importance of protecting extensive forest ecosystems that support such specialized and vulnerable species.
