# Violet Sabrewing

The Violet Sabrewing ranks among the largest and most spectacular hummingbirds in Costa Rica. Males display stunning violet plumage that shimmers in sunlight, while their aggressive temperament makes them dominant at feeding territories. This cloud forest specialist provides some of the most reliable and impressive hummingbird viewing opportunities in Costa Rica's highlands.

## Physical Characteristics

Violet Sabrewings are impressively large for hummingbirds, measuring 13-15 cm in length and weighing 9-12 grams. The species exhibits pronounced sexual dimorphism.

Males are unmistakable, with brilliant violet-blue plumage covering the head, throat, breast, and much of the body. The wings appear dark, and the tail is deep blue with white-tipped outer tail feathers. In certain light, the violet coloring appears almost electric in its intensity.

Females are much less flamboyant, displaying green upperparts, gray underparts, and the characteristic white tail tips. A white post-ocular spot behind the eye aids in identification. The bill is slightly decurved and black.

The name "sabrewing" refers to the thickened, flattened shafts of the outer primary feathers, though this feature requires close examination to observe. These modified feathers likely play a role in the distinctive sound produced during display flights.

## Habitat and Range

Violet Sabrewings inhabit montane and cloud forests at elevations between 1,200 and 2,500 meters. They show strong preferences for:

- Cloud forest with abundant epiphytes
- Forest edges and clearings with flowering plants
- Stream corridors with dense vegetation
- Areas with reliable nectar sources

In Costa Rica, prime locations include Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve, Poás Volcano National Park, the Central Highlands, and other highland protected areas. The species requires relatively pristine forest and becomes less common in heavily disturbed areas.

Unlike some hummingbirds that adapt to gardens and human-modified landscapes, Violet Sabrewings remain largely dependent on natural forest ecosystems, though they readily visit hummingbird feeders at lodges within their forest habitat.

## Behavior and Territoriality

Violet Sabrewings are notably aggressive for hummingbirds, dominating feeding territories through their size and pugnacious temperament. Males establish territories around productive flower patches or hummingbird feeders, vigorously excluding other hummingbirds regardless of size.

Territorial disputes involve dramatic aerial chases through the forest understory, with birds producing loud buzzing sounds with their wings. Despite their aggression toward other hummingbirds, they typically tolerate other bird species at flowering plants.

The wings produce distinctive sounds during flight, particularly during aggressive encounters and display flights. These mechanical sounds supplement vocal communication, which consists mainly of sharp chips and chattering calls.

## Diet and Feeding

Like all hummingbirds, Violet Sabrewings feed primarily on nectar, supplemented with small arthropods for protein. Their relatively large size and aggressive behavior allow them to monopolize rich food sources.

Favored nectar sources include:

- Heliconias
- Ginger family flowers
- Various epiphytic plants
- Ericaceous shrubs
- Stachytarpheta (porterweed)

The slightly decurved bill allows access to tubular flowers, though the species is less specialized than some hummingbirds and feeds opportunistically from various flower types.

Foraging occurs at all forest levels, from understory to canopy. Birds systematically patrol territories, checking flowers at regular intervals and chasing away intruders. At hummingbird feeders, individuals may spend considerable time perched nearby, guarding the resource.

Protein requirements are met through gleaning small spiders and insects from foliage and capturing flying insects in aerial sallies.

## Breeding Behavior

Violet Sabrewings breed during the early rainy season, typically from March to June, though timing varies with elevation and local conditions. Males are promiscuous, mating with multiple females and taking no part in nesting or chick-rearing.

Females construct tiny cup nests from plant fibers, moss, and spider silk, typically placed on a horizontal branch or in a fork well above ground. The nest exterior is camouflaged with moss and lichen, making detection difficult.

Two white eggs are laid and incubated solely by the female for approximately 15-17 days. Nestlings are fed regurgitated nectar and small arthropods, fledging at about 20-23 days old. Young birds resemble adult females but may show more brownish tones.

## Adaptation to Cloud Forest

Violet Sabrewings demonstrate numerous adaptations to cloud forest life. Their relatively large size helps maintain body temperature in the cool, misty conditions. The violet plumage may serve important functions in the filtered light conditions of dense forest.

During cool nights at high elevations, hummingbirds enter torpor, a state of reduced metabolic activity that conserves energy. Body temperature drops significantly, and the bird becomes unresponsive until warming in the morning.

The species' year-round residence in cloud forests requires different survival strategies than altitudinal migrants. Violet Sabrewings must maintain territories with reliable food sources throughout the year, including periods when flower availability fluctuates.

## Conservation Status

Listed as Least Concern globally, Violet Sabrewings maintain stable populations within suitable habitat. However, the species faces long-term concerns:

- Cloud forest habitat loss and fragmentation
- Climate change affecting montane ecosystems
- Competition for nectar resources with invasive plant species
- Reduced genetic connectivity between isolated forest patches

In Costa Rica, extensive protected areas in highland regions provide strongholds for the species. The popularity of cloud forest ecotourism has created economic incentives for habitat protection, benefiting Violet Sabrewings and associated species.

## Ecotourism and Observation

Violet Sabrewings are among the most sought-after birds for visitors to Costa Rica's cloud forests. Their large size, spectacular plumage, and aggressive behavior make them favorites at hummingbird feeders.

Lodges in Monteverde and other cloud forest areas typically maintain sugar-water feeders that attract multiple individuals. The aggressive interactions between males provide constant entertainment and excellent photography opportunities.

For best viewing:

- Visit cloud forest lodges with established hummingbird feeding stations
- Early morning and late afternoon see peak activity
- Look for males perched prominently on exposed branches guarding territories
- Listen for distinctive wing buzzing during aggressive encounters

The species' reliability at feeders makes it accessible even to non-birders, helping inspire appreciation for hummingbird diversity and cloud forest conservation.

## Ecological Role

As important pollinators of cloud forest plants, Violet Sabrewings contribute to forest ecosystem health. Their preference for certain flower types and their aggressive exclusion of smaller hummingbirds from these flowers affects pollination dynamics for multiple plant species.

The relationship between Violet Sabrewings and their preferred flowers represents coevolution, with plants producing flowers matching the birds' bill morphology and birds specializing on rewarding flower species. Understanding these relationships remains important for cloud forest conservation planning.
