# Rufous-tailed Hummingbird

The Rufous-tailed Hummingbird is Costa Rica's most common and widespread hummingbird species. Its adaptability, aggressive temperament, and tolerance of human-modified landscapes have made it ubiquitous from gardens to forest edges throughout much of the country. While it may lack the spectacular plumage of some hummingbirds, this species exemplifies successful adaptation to diverse environments and demonstrates that ecological flexibility can be as remarkable as specialized traits.

## Physical Characteristics

Rufous-tailed Hummingbirds are medium-sized for hummingbirds, measuring approximately 10 cm in total length and weighing 5-6 grams. The species exhibits modest sexual dimorphism.

Males display bronzy-green upperparts with a distinctive rufous tail that gives the species its name. The underparts are grayish-white to pale gray. The throat shows iridescent green gorget feathers, though this iridescence is less extensive and brilliant than in many hummingbirds. The bill is straight, medium-length, and black with a pinkish base to the lower mandible.

Females are similar but show reduced gorget iridescence, appearing duller overall. The rufous tail remains distinctive in both sexes. Juveniles resemble females but with buffy feather edges.

The overall appearance is relatively plain compared to spectacular species like Violet Sabrewings or Fiery-throated Hummingbirds, yet the combination of green body and rufous tail provides reliable field marks.

## Habitat and Remarkable Adaptability

Rufous-tailed Hummingbirds demonstrate extraordinary habitat flexibility, occurring from sea level to approximately 1,850 meters elevation across virtually all habitat types in Costa Rica:

- Humid lowland rainforest
- Dry forests
- Cloud forests (lower elevations)
- Forest edges and clearings
- Gardens and urban parks
- Agricultural areas
- Second growth and disturbed areas
- Coastal mangroves

This generalist strategy contrasts sharply with habitat specialists like Snowcaps or Violet Sabrewings, which require specific forest types. Rufous-tailed Hummingbirds thrive anywhere sufficient flowering plants and small arthropods occur.

Urban adaptation is particularly impressive. City parks, gardens, and even potted plants on balconies host these birds. They've become the hummingbird species most familiar to Costa Rican residents, observed daily by countless people.

This adaptability has likely increased with human landscape modification, as deforestation and agriculture created abundant edge habitat with high flower diversity.

## Aggressive Temperament and Territoriality

Despite modest size, Rufous-tailed Hummingbirds are notably aggressive, vigorously defending feeding territories. Males establish territories around productive flower patches or hummingbird feeders, attacking all intruders regardless of size.

Territorial behavior includes:

- High-speed aerial chases
- Vocal confrontations with sharp chip notes
- Physical contact during aggressive encounters
- Persistent defense throughout daylight hours

At feeders hosting multiple hummingbird species, Rufous-tailed Hummingbirds often dominate through sheer persistence. While larger species like Violet Sabrewings may win individual encounters, Rufous-tailed Hummingbirds wear down competitors through constant harassment.

This aggressive temperament and generalist ecology create a successful combination. The species can establish territories in marginal habitats where specialized species cannot survive, facing reduced competition.

## Diet and Foraging

Rufous-tailed Hummingbirds consume nectar from diverse flower species, their medium-length bill providing access to many flower types without extreme specialization. Nectar sources include:

- Native forest flowers across many families
- Garden ornamentals
- Crops (bananas, coffee when in flower)
- Heliconias
- Gingers
- Numerous other flowering plants

This dietary flexibility allows exploitation of temporal and spatial variation in flower availability. When one resource declines, birds shift to alternatives.

Arthropod prey provides essential protein, particularly during breeding season. Small flies, spiders, and other tiny arthropods are captured through gleaning and aerial hawking. Some foraging occurs at spider webs, where birds steal trapped insects.

At hummingbird feeders, Rufous-tailed Hummingbirds are typically the most common visitors, often dominating feeders through aggressive territorial defense.

## Breeding Biology

Rufous-tailed Hummingbirds can breed year-round where conditions permit, though peak breeding occurs during early wet season (April-July). Like most hummingbirds, they are promiscuous with no pair bonding or male parental care.

Females build tiny cup nests from plant fibers and spider silk, camouflaged with moss and lichen. Typical placement includes:

- Horizontal branches or forks
- Vines and hanging vegetation
- Human structures (wires, pipes, under eaves)
- 1-4 meters above ground

The placement versatility allows nesting across diverse habitats. Urban populations nest on all manner of human structures, demonstrating remarkable behavioral flexibility.

Two white eggs are laid and incubated solely by the female for 15-17 days. Nestlings receive regurgitated nectar and arthropods, fledging at 20-23 days old. Females may raise multiple broods annually in favorable conditions.

The extended breeding season and multiple brood capability contribute to the species' abundance and range expansion.

## Vocalizations

Rufous-tailed Hummingbirds produce sharp, metallic chip notes, often delivered in rapid series during aggressive encounters. These calls are among the most frequently heard hummingbird vocalizations in Costa Rica.

During territorial displays, males produce accelerating series of chips while performing aerial maneuvers. The calls serve both as territorial advertisement and aggressive signals to competitors.

Compared to some hummingbirds with elaborate songs or calls, Rufous-tailed Hummingbirds have relatively simple vocalizations. The sharp chips are functional rather than musical, suited to aggressive territorial defense.

## Ecological Role

As abundant generalists, Rufous-tailed Hummingbirds play important pollination roles across diverse ecosystems. Their lack of specialization means they pollinate numerous plant species, contributing broadly to ecosystem function.

However, their aggression and dominance may negatively impact specialist hummingbird species by excluding them from resources. In disturbed habitats where Rufous-tailed Hummingbirds thrive and specialists decline, pollination networks may shift toward generalist interactions.

The species represents the "winners" in anthropogenic environmental change—adaptable species that increase while specialists decline. Understanding such generalist success is important for predicting ecosystem changes under continued human modification.

## Conservation Status

Rufous-tailed Hummingbirds are listed as Least Concern with increasing populations throughout their range. The species epitomizes successful adaptation to human environmental modification.

Rather than facing conservation threats, Rufous-tailed Hummingbirds likely benefit from current conditions. Habitat modification creating edge habitats and flowering gardens supports higher densities than pristine forest.

This raises interesting conservation questions about common versus rare species. While Rufous-tailed Hummingbirds require no conservation intervention, should they be managed in areas where they might outcompete vulnerable specialists?

## Observation and Identification

Rufous-tailed Hummingbirds are arguably Costa Rica's easiest hummingbird to observe. Their abundance, habitat accessibility, and tolerance of humans ensure regular encounters.

Identification relies on:

- Rufous tail (distinctive field mark)
- Bronzy-green upperparts
- Grayish underparts
- Modest iridescence compared to many species
- Aggressive behavior
- Sharp chip calls

At feeders hosting multiple species, Rufous-tailed Hummingbirds are typically present and often dominant. Their abundance provides excellent opportunities to observe hummingbird behavior, feeding, and territorial interactions.

For beginning birders and photographers, this species offers ideal subjects for learning hummingbird identification and developing observation skills applicable to other species.

## Symbol of Adaptation

While spectacular rarities capture most attention, Rufous-tailed Hummingbirds demonstrate that ecological success sometimes comes through flexibility rather than specialization. Their ability to thrive across diverse habitats and conditions represents an equally remarkable evolutionary strategy.

The species reminds us that common animals deserve study and appreciation. Understanding why some species succeed while others decline provides crucial insights for conservation in rapidly changing environments.

For Costa Ricans and visitors alike, the familiar Rufous-tailed Hummingbird represents accessible nature, demonstrating that wildlife encounters need not be rare events in distant forests. Sometimes the most remarkable adaptations occur in the backyard.
