# Three-wattled Bellbird

The Three-wattled Bellbird ranks among the most unusual and fascinating birds in Costa Rica. Males are renowned for producing one of the loudest bird calls on Earth, a distinctive metallic "bonk" that can be heard over half a mile away. The species earns its name from the three worm-like wattles that dangle from the male's bill.

## Physical Characteristics

Adult males display striking chestnut brown plumage on the body with a white head, neck, and breast. The most remarkable feature consists of three black, worm-like wattles hanging from the base of the bill. These fleshy appendages can extend up to 10 cm when fully developed during breeding season.

Females and immature males lack wattles and display more uniform olive-brown coloration throughout. Males undergo several years of plumage maturation before acquiring full adult coloration and wattles.

Birds measure 25-30 cm in length, making them moderately sized members of the cotinga family.

## The Remarkable Call

Male bellbirds produce one of nature's most extraordinary vocalizations. The primary call sounds like a loud, resonant "bonk" with metallic quality, often described as similar to a hammer striking an anvil. Males can produce calls exceeding 100 decibels, among the loudest sounds made by any bird.

Calling males typically perch high in the forest canopy on exposed branches. They perform elaborate displays while calling, opening the mouth widely and shaking the wattles. Multiple males may call from the same general area, creating a chorus that reverberates through the cloud forest.

## Habitat and Migration

Three-wattled Bellbirds inhabit montane and cloud forests at elevations between 1,200 and 3,000 meters. However, they are altitudinal migrants, making seasonal movements in response to fruit availability:

- **Breeding Season** (March-September): Highland cloud forests including Monteverde and Los Angeles Cloud Forest
- **Non-breeding Season**: Descend to lowland Caribbean and Pacific forests

This migration pattern makes them unpredictable, present at specific sites only seasonally. Their movements are closely tied to the fruiting cycles of trees in the laurel family.

## Diet and Foraging

Bellbirds are almost exclusively frugivorous, specializing in laurel family fruits. They pluck fruits while perched or hovering, swallowing them whole and later regurgitating seeds. This behavior makes them important seed dispersers for numerous cloud forest tree species.

Unlike many frugivorous birds, bellbirds show strong preferences for specific fruit species and will travel considerable distances to locate fruiting trees. Groups may gather at productive fruiting sites.

## Breeding Behavior

Males are polygamous and do not participate in nesting or chick-rearing. They establish display territories in the canopy and spend much of the breeding season calling to attract females.

Females build small, flimsy cup nests placed on horizontal branches, often quite exposed. A single egg is laid and incubated for approximately 17 days. The chick fledges at about 24 days, among the shortest nestling periods for birds of this size.

## Conservation Status

The species is listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN. Population declines result from:

- Cloud forest habitat loss throughout Central America
- Climate change affecting forest ecology and fruiting patterns
- Forest fragmentation disrupting migration routes
- Limited breeding range

Costa Rica maintains some of the species' most important remaining habitat. Protected areas like Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve and Children's Eternal Rainforest provide crucial breeding grounds.

## Where to Observe

Finding Three-wattled Bellbirds requires being in the right place at the right season. Best observation opportunities include:

- Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve (March-August)
- Los Angeles Cloud Forest Reserve (breeding season)
- San Gerardo de Dota (seasonal)

The loud calls make males relatively easy to locate when present, though spotting them in the dense canopy can be challenging. Local guides familiar with current locations and calling sites significantly improve viewing success.

## Ecological Importance

Research has demonstrated the bellbird's critical role in cloud forest ecosystems as a long-distance seed disperser. Their seasonal migrations carry seeds between highland and lowland forests, maintaining genetic connectivity for numerous tree species across elevation gradients. Protecting bellbirds thus protects entire forest communities.
