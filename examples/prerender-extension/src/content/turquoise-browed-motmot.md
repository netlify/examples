# Turquoise-browed Motmot

The Turquoise-browed Motmot, Nicaragua's national bird, also graces the dry forests of northwestern Costa Rica. With its spectacular turquoise eyebrow, elaborate tail racquets, and cinnamon underparts, this is arguably the most beautiful motmot species. Its preference for open, arid woodlands distinguishes it from Costa Rica's other motmots, making it a specialty of Guanacaste's distinctive dry forest ecosystem.

## Physical Characteristics

Turquoise-browed Motmots measure 30-34 cm in total length, making them the smallest motmot species regularly occurring in Costa Rica. Despite smaller size, they match or exceed other motmots in visual splendor.

The head displays the species' most striking feature—brilliant turquoise eyebrows arching over the eyes, bordered by black. The throat is turquoise, and a black patch marks the breast. The upperparts are greenish, while the underparts are rich cinnamon-rufous, more extensively and brightly colored than in other Costa Rican motmots.

The long tail shows blue-green coloring with distinctive racquet tips formed by bare feather shafts terminating in broad spatulas. The racquets are proportionally larger and more ornate than in related species.

The bill is broad, slightly decurved, and black with serrated edges. Males and females appear identical. Juveniles show duller colors and incompletely developed tail racquets.

The overall appearance is spectacularly colorful, combining turquoise, cinnamon, green, and black in striking patterns. Many observers consider this the most beautiful motmot species.

## Habitat and Distribution

Turquoise-browed Motmots inhabit tropical dry forests and semi-arid scrublands from southern Mexico through Central America. In Costa Rica, they occur primarily in Guanacaste Province, particularly in the drier northwestern regions, from sea level to approximately 700 meters elevation.

Preferred habitat differs markedly from other Costa Rican motmots:

- Tropical dry forest (deciduous)
- Dry scrubland and thorn forest
- Open woodlands with scattered trees
- Forest edges along agricultural areas
- Gallery forests in dry regions

The species thrives in seasonally dry environments experiencing pronounced wet and dry seasons. During the dry season, many trees lose leaves, creating more open conditions than humid forests. This habitat preference segregates Turquoise-browed Motmots from Blue-crowned and Lesson's Motmots ecologically.

In Costa Rica, reliable locations include Santa Rosa National Park, Palo Verde National Park, northern Nicoya Peninsula, and other Guanacaste dry forest areas.

The species reaches its southern range limit in northwestern Costa Rica, becoming increasingly rare toward the central Pacific coast.

## Behavior and Perch-Hunting

Like all motmots, Turquoise-browed Motmots exhibit the characteristic pendulum tail-swinging behavior. The large, ornate racquets create particularly striking visual effects during this behavior.

Hunting strategy follows the typical motmot pattern: sit-and-wait predation from exposed perches. Birds select perches with good visibility, often on dead snags, fence posts, or exposed branches. They remain motionless except for the slowly swinging tail, watching for prey movement.

Upon detecting prey, they sally forth to capture it, returning to the perch to consume larger items. The bill's serrated edges provide grip on struggling prey.

In open dry forest habitat, Turquoise-browed Motmots perch more conspicuously than forest-interior species, making them relatively easy to observe when present.

## Vocalizations

Turquoise-browed Motmots produce distinctive calls differing from other motmot species. The primary vocalization consists of a guttural, rolling "crrrr-oop" or "grrr-doop" delivered in evenly spaced pairs or series.

These calls are often described as softer and more melodious than the hoots of Blue-crowned or Lesson's Motmots. The calls carry well through open woodland and serve territorial and pair bonding functions.

Calling peaks during early morning and late afternoon, particularly during breeding season. Both sexes call, possibly duetting at times.

Birds also produce harsh chattering alarm calls and mechanical bill-snapping when threatened or during aggressive encounters.

## Diet and Foraging

Turquoise-browed Motmots consume diverse prey suited to dry forest ecosystems:

- **Large insects**: Particularly abundant in dry forests, including beetles, cicadas, grasshoppers, mantids
- **Arachnids**: Spiders, scorpions, and other arthropods
- **Small vertebrates**: Lizards (especially abundant in dry forests), small snakes, frogs
- **Fruits**: Seasonal fruits when available

The dry season concentration of insects around remaining water sources and flowering plants creates predictable foraging opportunities. Motmots station themselves near these resources, capturing prey as it becomes active.

Foraging occurs at various heights from near ground to canopy. The species' tolerance of open habitat allows ground foraging more frequently than forest motmots.

Larger prey items are beaten against perches before consumption. Indigestible parts are regurgitated as pellets.

## Breeding Biology

Breeding coincides with the late dry season and early wet season (March-June), timing reproduction with peak food availability. Turquoise-browed Motmots are monogamous with long-term pair bonds.

Nests are burrows excavated in earthen banks, following the motmot family pattern. Suitable sites include:

- Stream banks (even dry season watercourses)
- Road cuts and erosion features
- Exposed earth in pastures and agricultural areas
- Sometimes flat ground

Both sexes excavate the burrow, which may extend 1-2 meters terminating in an enlarged chamber. Excavation in the hard, dry soils of Guanacaste requires considerable effort.

The female lays 3-4 white eggs on the bare chamber floor. Both parents share incubation for approximately 20-22 days. Nestlings are fed regurgitated food, fledging at about 30-32 days old.

The nest burrow becomes fouled during the nestling period but is abandoned after use rather than cleaned and reused.

## National Symbol of Nicaragua

The Turquoise-browed Motmot's status as Nicaragua's national bird reflects its cultural significance throughout Central America. The bird appears in Nicaraguan art, literature, and folklore.

Its beauty, approachability, and presence in human-modified landscapes made it an appropriate national symbol. The species represents Central American dry forest ecosystems and the region's distinctive biodiversity.

In Nicaragua, the bird is called "Guardabarranco," meaning "ravine-guard," referring to its nesting behavior in earthen banks.

## Adaptation to Dry Forests

Turquoise-browed Motmots demonstrate numerous adaptations to seasonally arid environments:

- Tolerance of high temperatures and direct sun
- Ability to exploit concentrated dry season resources
- Nesting timed to coincide with wet season when food abundance increases
- Opportunistic diet shifting with seasonal availability

These adaptations allow exploitation of ecological niches unavailable to humid forest specialists. Dry forest ecosystems, often overlooked compared to rainforests, harbor distinctive species assemblages including this spectacular bird.

## Conservation Status

Turquoise-browed Motmots are listed as Least Concern with stable populations throughout their range. The species' tolerance of habitat disturbance and ability to thrive in agricultural landscapes provide resilience.

In Guanacaste, extensive dry forest protection in national parks ensures habitat security. The species also persists well in cattle pastures and agricultural areas provided some trees and suitable nesting banks remain.

However, complete deforestation eliminates populations, and intensive agriculture without retained trees reduces abundance. Conservation of dry forest ecosystems benefits Turquoise-browed Motmots alongside numerous other species.

Dry forests have historically received less conservation attention than rainforests but harbor unique biodiversity worthy of protection. The Turquoise-browed Motmot serves as an ambassador for these underappreciated ecosystems.

## Observation and Photography

Turquoise-browed Motmots are relatively easy to observe in appropriate habitat. Their tolerance of open country and tendency to perch conspicuously facilitate detection.

Best observation strategies include:

- Driving slowly along roads through dry forest areas
- Checking fence posts and prominent perches
- Early morning and late afternoon for peak activity
- Listening for distinctive calls
- Visiting known territories during breeding season

The spectacular plumage and approachability make them excellent photography subjects. Birds often allow close approach, particularly when focused on hunting.

Many visitors to Guanacaste encounter these stunning birds even without specifically searching, as they frequent roadsides and lodge grounds in appropriate habitat.

## Ecological Role

As predators of insects and small vertebrates, Turquoise-browed Motmots contribute to ecosystem balance in dry forests. Their consumption of large insects provides natural pest control.

The species' frugivory contributes to seed dispersal, though this represents a minor component of their ecological impact compared to specialized frugivores.

Their presence indicates relatively healthy dry forest ecosystems with adequate prey populations and suitable nesting habitat. As such, they serve as useful indicators of ecosystem condition.

## Symbol of Dry Forest Biodiversity

The Turquoise-browed Motmot represents the unique biodiversity of Central America's tropical dry forests. These seasonally arid ecosystems support distinctive species assemblages found nowhere else.

For birders visiting Costa Rica's Pacific northwest, the Turquoise-browed Motmot ranks among the most sought-after species. Its spectacular appearance, interesting behavior, and restriction to dry forests make it a regional specialty worth seeking.

The bird demonstrates that biodiversity conservation must protect diverse ecosystem types. While rainforests receive most attention, dry forests harbor equally remarkable and increasingly threatened species. The Turquoise-browed Motmot reminds us that conservation requires comprehensive approaches addressing all habitats.
