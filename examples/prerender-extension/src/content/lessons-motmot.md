# Lesson's Motmot

Lesson's Motmot is a beautiful and distinctive bird of Caribbean slope forests, recognized by its striking turquoise crown and characteristic racquet-tipped tail. Like all motmots, this species exhibits the peculiar behavior of swinging its tail like a pendulum while perched. Endemic to Central America, Lesson's Motmot represents one of several closely related motmot species found in Costa Rica, each occupying different habitats and regions.

## Physical Characteristics

Lesson's Motmots measure 41-48 cm in total length, with much of this consisting of the elongated tail. The body is robust, measuring approximately 25 cm. Weight ranges from 100-145 grams.

The plumage is predominantly green with a cinnamon-rufous breast and belly. The most striking feature is the brilliant turquoise-blue crown and black mask extending through the eye. The throat displays a small black patch bordered by blue. The long tail is blue-green, with the central tail feathers extending beyond the others and terminating in spatula-shaped racquets.

The racquet tail develops through an unusual process. Initially, tail feathers grow normally. Barbs on a section of the central feather shafts are weakly attached and fall out through preening, creating the bare shaft with terminal racquet. This is not damage but rather a deliberate structural feature.

The bill is broad, slightly decurved, and black with serrated edges adapted for gripping prey. Males and females appear identical. Juveniles show duller coloration and incompletely developed tail racquets.

## Habitat and Distribution

Lesson's Motmot inhabits humid lowland and foothill forests on the Caribbean slope from Honduras through Costa Rica to northern Colombia. In Costa Rica, the species occurs from sea level to approximately 1,200 meters elevation.

Preferred habitat includes:

- Humid lowland rainforest interior
- Forest edges and clearings
- Stream corridors and ravines
- Secondary forest with good canopy development
- Plantations with shade trees

Unlike some forest species, Lesson's Motmots tolerate moderate habitat disturbance and can persist in secondary forest and partially cleared areas provided some forest structure remains.

Key observation locations include Sarapiquí region, La Selva Biological Station, Tortuguero, and other Caribbean lowland forests. The species generally occurs at lower elevations than Blue-crowned Motmot, reducing competition between these related species.

## The Pendulum Tail

The most characteristic behavior of motmots is tail-swinging. Perched birds slowly swing their tails from side to side like a pendulum. This behavior has inspired considerable speculation about its function:

- **Predator confusion**: The moving tail may draw predator strikes away from vital body parts
- **Communication**: Tail movements may signal to conspecifics or potential predators
- **Insect attraction**: Some researchers suggest movement attracts flying insects into strike range
- **Nervous behavior**: May simply represent displacement activity

Research has not definitively established the tail-swinging function, and multiple factors may contribute. Regardless of purpose, the behavior is diagnostic and aids in locating motmots in dense vegetation.

## Vocalizations

Lesson's Motmots produce distinctive calls that help birders locate them in dense forest. The primary vocalization consists of a low, soft "hoop-hoop" or "whoop-whoop" delivered in regularly spaced pairs. These hooting calls carry well through forest understory.

Calling activity peaks during early morning and late afternoon, with reduced vocalization during midday. Both sexes call, though males may vocalize more frequently.

Alarm calls consist of harsh chattering when threatened or disturbed. Birds also produce mechanical bill-snapping sounds during aggressive encounters or when agitated.

The calls of different motmot species vary in pitch, tempo, and pattern, allowing identification by voice even when birds remain concealed in vegetation.

## Diet and Foraging Behavior

Lesson's Motmots are opportunistic predators consuming diverse prey. The diet includes:

- **Large insects**: Beetles, cicadas, katydids, grasshoppers
- **Small vertebrates**: Lizards, small snakes, frogs
- **Fruits**: Berries and small fruits, particularly from palms and forest understory plants
- **Arthropods**: Spiders, centipedes, scorpions

Foraging occurs primarily through sit-and-wait hunting. Birds perch quietly on branches at low to mid-levels, scanning for prey. Upon detecting movement, they sally forth to capture prey in their bill, returning to the perch to consume it.

Large prey items are beaten against the perch to subdue them and break up hard parts before swallowing. Indigestible material is regurgitated as pellets.

The broad, serrated bill provides a strong grip on struggling prey. This bill morphology distinguishes motmots from kingfishers and other superficially similar birds.

## Breeding Biology

Breeding season spans March through August, with peak activity during early wet season. Lesson's Motmots are monogamous, with pairs maintaining territories year-round.

Nests are excavated in earthen banks, similar to kingfisher nesting behavior. Suitable sites include:

- Stream and river banks
- Road cuts and erosion gullies
- Exposed soil in forest gaps
- Occasionally flat ground if soil conditions permit

Both sexes participate in excavating the burrow, which may extend 1-2 meters into the bank and terminate in an enlarged chamber. Excavation requires several weeks of effort.

The female lays 3-4 white eggs directly on the bare earth of the chamber floor. Both parents share incubation duties, which last approximately 21 days. Nestlings are fed regurgitated food, fledging at about 30 days old.

The nest burrow and chamber become progressively fouled during the nestling period but are typically abandoned after use rather than cleaned for reuse.

## Relationship with Other Motmots

Costa Rica hosts several motmot species, with Lesson's Motmot largely segregated by habitat and elevation from its relatives. Blue-crowned Motmots overlap in range but generally occur at higher elevations and in drier forests. Turquoise-browed Motmots are limited to northwestern dry forests.

This habitat partitioning reduces competition between closely related species with similar ecological requirements. Where ranges overlap, subtle differences in prey selection and foraging height further minimize competitive interactions.

The different motmot species represent adaptive radiation, with ancestral populations diversifying to exploit different ecological niches across the Central American landscape.

## Conservation Status

Lesson's Motmot is listed as Least Concern with stable populations throughout its range. The species' tolerance of secondary forest and habitat edges provides resilience to moderate deforestation.

However, the species requires suitable nesting banks and some forest cover. Complete deforestation eliminates populations, and heavy siltation of streams can reduce nesting site availability.

In Costa Rica, extensive protected areas on the Caribbean slope ensure habitat security for significant populations. The species' adaptability suggests it will persist in mosaic landscapes combining forest patches with agriculture.

## Observation and Photography

Lesson's Motmots are relatively easy to observe when present. Their sit-and-wait hunting strategy means individuals remain stationary for extended periods, allowing excellent views. The distinctive call aids location.

Best observation strategies include:

- Walking quietly along forest trails, listening for calls
- Checking exposed perches overlooking streams and clearings
- Early morning and late afternoon when activity peaks
- Locating nest burrows during breeding season

The tail-swinging behavior provides an excellent observation focus, as the movement draws the eye even when the bird's cryptic coloration provides camouflage.

Photographers appreciate motmots as cooperative subjects. Their perch-hunting behavior and tolerance of slow approach allow excellent photography opportunities. The combination of beautiful plumage, distinctive tail, and interesting behavior makes them popular subjects.

## Ecological Role

As mid-sized predators, Lesson's Motmots contribute to forest ecosystem function by controlling insect and small vertebrate populations. Their opportunistic diet means they respond to prey abundance, potentially helping regulate population outbreaks.

The species' frugivory contributes to seed dispersal for various understory plants, though this represents a minor component of their ecological impact compared to specialized frugivores.

Their presence indicates relatively healthy forest ecosystems with adequate prey populations and suitable nesting habitat, making them useful indicators of forest quality.
