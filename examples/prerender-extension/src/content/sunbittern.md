# Sunbittern

The Sunbittern is one of the most unusual and spectacular birds in Costa Rica. When threatened or displaying, this cryptically-colored wader spreads its wings to reveal a breathtaking pattern of orange, yellow, black, and white resembling a giant butterfly or a setting sun. This unique species represents the sole member of its family, an evolutionary lineage with no close relatives.

## Physical Characteristics

Sunbitterns are medium-sized wading birds measuring 43-48 cm in length with a wingspan reaching 71 cm. Weight ranges from 180-220 grams. The overall build is slender with a long neck, elongated body, and relatively long legs.

When wings are folded, the plumage appears cryptic—mottled brown, black, gray, and white providing excellent camouflage against streambeds and forest floors. Fine barring and vermiculation create complex patterns. The head shows bold black and white stripes, and the neck displays horizontal barring.

The true spectacle emerges when the bird spreads its wings. The opened wings reveal spectacular patterns of orange, chestnut, yellow, black, and white arranged in concentric bands and eye-spots. This display transforms the drab bird into a dazzling vision, one of nature's most dramatic transformations.

The bill is long, straight, and pointed, colored orange-yellow with a darker tip. Legs are orange to red. Males and females appear identical. Juveniles show similar patterns but with duller coloration.

## Habitat and Distribution

Sunbitterns inhabit forested streams, rivers, and wetlands throughout much of Central and South America. In Costa Rica, they occur on both Caribbean and Pacific slopes from sea level to approximately 1,500 meters elevation.

Critical habitat features include:

- Clear, shallow streams with rocky or sandy bottoms
- Dense riparian vegetation providing cover
- Overhanging vegetation along stream banks
- Forest or second-growth surrounding waterways
- Minimal human disturbance

Unlike many wetland birds that occupy open marshes and lakes, Sunbitterns are forest stream specialists. They require the combination of aquatic foraging habitat and forest cover, making them vulnerable to both deforestation and stream degradation.

Sunbitterns occur throughout Costa Rica's forested regions but are nowhere abundant. Populations are naturally sparse, with individual birds or pairs occupying long stream stretches.

## The Spectacular Display

The Sunbittern's wing display represents one of the most impressive behaviors in Costa Rica's avifauna. The display serves multiple functions:

**Threat Display**: When threatened, Sunbitterns spread their wings fully, creating a sudden transformation from cryptic to spectacular. The eye-spots and bright colors may startle predators or make the bird appear larger and more formidable.

**Courtship Display**: During breeding, both sexes perform displays with wings spread and tail fanned. Birds face each other, swaying and moving in coordinated patterns.

**Territorial Display**: Territorial disputes may involve wing-spreading displays between rivals.

The display's evolution likely involved multiple selective pressures, with the wing patterns serving both defense and reproduction. The sudden revelation of bright colors represents a classic example of flash coloration, where cryptic animals suddenly reveal bright patterns to confuse predators.

## Vocalizations

Sunbitterns produce a variety of vocalizations, though they are generally quiet birds. The most common call is a thin, high-pitched whistle, sometimes delivered in series. During breeding season, both sexes produce soft, melodious whistling sounds during courtship.

Alarm calls consist of sharper, more urgent notes. Young birds produce begging calls when soliciting food from parents.

Sunbitterns also produce non-vocal sounds by rattling their bills, particularly during aggressive encounters or when agitated.

## Diet and Foraging Behavior

Sunbitterns are carnivorous, feeding on aquatic and terrestrial prey found along streams and wetlands. The diet includes:

- **Fish**: Small fish captured in shallow water
- **Aquatic insects**: Dragonfly nymphs, water beetles, other aquatic insects
- **Crustaceans**: Freshwater crabs, crayfish, shrimp
- **Amphibians**: Small frogs and tadpoles
- **Insects**: Terrestrial insects found along stream margins
- **Small vertebrates**: Occasionally small lizards or mice

Foraging occurs through slow, deliberate stalking along stream edges and through shallow water. The bird moves carefully, freezing frequently to scan for prey. Upon detecting movement, it strikes quickly with the sharp bill, capturing prey with impressive accuracy.

Unlike herons that often stand and wait, Sunbitterns actively search while moving, probing under stones and vegetation. The cryptic plumage provides camouflage while hunting.

Sunbitterns hunt primarily during early morning and late afternoon, resting in shaded areas during midday heat.

## Breeding Biology

Sunbitterns breed during the dry season and early wet season (February-July), with timing varying by location. They are monogamous, with pairs maintaining long-term bonds and territories.

Nests are substantial platforms constructed from mud, sticks, and plant material. Typical placement includes:

- Horizontal tree branches overhanging water
- Dense vegetation along stream banks
- Occasionally on cliff ledges
- 2-6 meters above water or ground

Both sexes participate in nest construction, which may require several weeks. The nest bowl is lined with softer materials.

The female typically lays 2 eggs (occasionally 1 or 3), colored buff with brown and gray markings. Both parents share incubation duties for approximately 27-30 days, one of the longer incubation periods for birds of this size.

Chicks are semi-precocial, covered in down and able to move about the nest but requiring parental care. Both parents feed nestlings, which fledge at about 21-28 days old. Family groups may remain together for weeks after fledging.

## Taxonomic Uniqueness

The Sunbittern is the sole member of the family Eurypygidae, representing an ancient evolutionary lineage. Its nearest relatives are unclear, though genetic studies suggest affinities with Kagu (another unique bird from New Caledonia) and possibly rails.

This taxonomic isolation means the Sunbittern has no close living relatives. The family likely represents a relict lineage that was more diverse in the past but has been reduced to a single species through extinction of related forms.

Studying such unique lineages provides insights into avian evolution and biogeography, making the Sunbittern scientifically valuable beyond its visual appeal.

## Conservation Status

The Sunbittern is listed as Least Concern globally, with populations considered stable. However, the species faces localized threats:

- Stream degradation from agricultural runoff and siltation
- Deforestation of riparian forests
- Water pollution affecting prey populations
- Human disturbance at nesting sites
- Climate change potentially affecting stream flow patterns

In Costa Rica, protected areas with intact forest streams provide secure habitat. However, streams outside protected areas face ongoing degradation from various human activities.

The species' naturally low population density and large territorial requirements make them vulnerable to habitat loss despite current stable status.

## Observation Opportunities

Finding Sunbitterns requires patience, knowledge, and often luck. The species' cryptic plumage and secretive nature make detection challenging. Best strategies include:

- Walking quietly along forested streams
- Early morning and late afternoon when birds are most active
- Scanning overhanging branches where birds may perch
- Listening for vocalizations
- Checking stream pools and riffles methodically

Many birders visit Costa Rica multiple times before successfully observing Sunbitterns. When located, birds may allow close approach if observers move slowly and quietly.

The wing display is most likely during breeding season or if birds are disturbed. However, intentionally flushing birds to trigger displays is discouraged as it causes stress.

Sunbitterns occur at various lodges and reserves throughout Costa Rica, but there are no truly reliable locations. Local guides with knowledge of territorial birds increase observation success.

## Cultural and Educational Significance

The Sunbittern's spectacular display and unique evolutionary status make it popular in environmental education. Images of displaying birds appear in countless nature publications, inspiring wonder about avian diversity.

For ecotourists and birders, successfully finding and photographing a Sunbittern represents a significant achievement. The species exemplifies the hidden treasures awaiting those who explore Costa Rica's forests patiently.

The Sunbittern reminds us that spectacular wildlife isn't always rare or endangered—sometimes it's hiding in plain sight, waiting to reveal its secrets to careful observers.
