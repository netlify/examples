## Blob x blobs example

This is a client-side React application loaded as an [Astro
island](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/) for editing, uploading and viewing blob
shapes to the blob store.

With Astro, you can implement client-side interactivity with any framework (or frameworks!) of your
choice: React, Vue, Svelte, Solid.js - it's up to you.

Uploading is implemented with [Astro Actions](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/actions), which
allow the client to submit mutations to the server without any boilerplate. And it just works on Netlify!

Generate a random blob shape, and then click the upload button to store the shape in the blob store.
You can then select the shape from the dropdown menu to view it.
